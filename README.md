# ROS Robotics Exploration
Welcome to the ROS Robotics Exploration repository! This repository contains various ROS packages created during the exploration of ROS tools such as URDF, Xacro, RViz, and Gazebo. 

## Package 1: robot_model_pkg (URDF and RViz)
This package demonstrates the creation of a robot description using URDF and visualizing it in RViz.
### Running the Package
1. run `roscore` in new terminal
2. Open new terminal
```bash
roslaunch robot_model_pkg robot.launch
```

## Package 2: robot_xacro_model_pkg (Xacro and RViz)
This package showcases the utilization of Xacro for robot description and visualization in RViz.
### Running the Package
1. run `roscore` in new terminal
2. Open new terminal
```bash
roslaunch robot_xacro_model_pkg robot_xacro.launch
```

## Package 3: robot_gazebo_model_pkg (Xacro and Gazebo)
This package demonstrates the integration of Xacro with Gazebo for simulating robots.
### Running the Package
1. run `roscore` in new terminal
2. Open new terminal
```bash
roslaunch robot_gazebo_model_pkg robot_xacro.launch
```
